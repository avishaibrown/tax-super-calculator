This app was built as an electronic form for new bank staff to fill out during the onboarding process. It is a simple form divided into 3 sections contained inside of accordion components. The sections include the following fields:

- Name
- Date of Birth
- Email
- Phone Number
- Employee ID (autogenerated)
- Department
- Job Title
- Gross Salary
- Annual Tax (calculated field)
- Annual Superannuation Contribution (calculated field)
- Annual Net Salary (calculated field)

The tax, superannuation and net salary calculations are completed on the fly as the user types in the Gross Salary field. On submit, a payload is prepared for the backend.

The app uses Material UI for all of the components as they are well-designed, accessible, robust, responsive and easy to implement and use out-of-the-box. Accordions were chosen to contain the sections as they are compact when collapsed and allow the user to focus each section when expanded.

Since it is a simple form, no validation has been included and the fields have been hardcoded.

One assumption made is that superannuation is not deducted from the gross salary.
